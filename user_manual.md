## General Overview

The goal of the Brand Analyzer App is to allow you to analyze the online reputation and sentiment of any popular brand or business you input. This is performed by gathering online posts from Reddit and analyzing the sentiment of these posts. The system will return information and data about the brand back to you.

  

The aim of this project is to streamline the process of acquiring the online opinion about a brand and making it much easier to find. This will give more power back to customers and users of a service, brand or business like you. The information available in this guide will give you instructions on how to use this application to perform its goal.

**General Overview** section explains in general, what the Brand Analyzer App will do for you and what the goal of the application is.

**Contingencies** section explains what could potentially stop the application from performing in a functional manner.

At the top of the page is the name of the brand, In the top left box is a pie chart displaying the percentage of how the data is positive versus negative. Red is for negative and green is for positive in the pie chart.

The results tab will not be on the navigation bar after you've left, and since the results will not be stored, be sure you do not accidentally press the arrow pointing back after acquiring your results.
