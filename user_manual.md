## General Overview

The goal of the Brand Analyzer App is to allow you to analyze the online reputation and sentiment of any popular brand or business you input. This is performed by gathering online posts from Reddit and analyzing the sentiment of these posts. The system will return information and data about the brand back to you.

The aim of this project is to streamline the process of acquiring the online opinion about a brand and making it much easier to find. This will give more power back to customers and users of a service, brand or business like you. The information available in this guide will give you instructions on how to use this application to perform its goal.

## Organization Of The Manual
The user manual consists of 4 sections: General Overview, Contingencies, Navigating The Application and System Features.
**General Overview** section explains in general, what the Brand Analyzer App will do for you and what the goal of the application is.
**Contingencies** section explains what could potentially stop the application from performing in a functional manner.
**Navigating The Application** section explains how the user interface operates and what the workflow design of the application is like.
**System Features** section explains what the system is capable and what users like you can do with the application.

## Contingencies
You must have an Android Version 4.0 mobile phone or later to run the application properly. If you are utilising an Android Virtual Machine, you must use Android Version 4.1 later or the application will not function.
